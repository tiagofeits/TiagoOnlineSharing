Tiago's Online Sharing of Projects

This is a small application which consists of a .net MVC backend with a sql server database to one table and it's basic operations. 
The frontend is built with angular/bootstrap/toastr to query, filter, validate, edit and delete records of the table.
The table in itself is just four columns of common attributes of a system user, like name and email.
